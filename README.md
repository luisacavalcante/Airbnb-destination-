Project to identify users that are not yet sure where to travel yet.

For that, I used the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/airbnb-recruiting-new-user-bookings/data

Before classification, I did a sequence of data treatments, creating and editing features to the main goal of the project.  

To the classification I used 3 algorithms: Random Forest, KNN and Naive Bayes 

Then, using techniques of explainable AI, I highlighted the features or users with more uncertainty.
